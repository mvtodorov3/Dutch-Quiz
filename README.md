# Dutch-Quiz
This program can help you to practice your basic knowledge in the dutch language.

From the home menu you are presented with 4 options. 
Each option takes you to a 7 questions quiz with corresponding options.
On every question when you have selected an option the program will print if it is the correct answer or the wrong answer.
If it is the wrong answer the program will print the right one.

After completion of the quiz there will be a breakdown on how many right and wrong answers have you given.
And a success rate measured in percents. If you have 80 or more percent the program prints that you have passed the quiz but if it is under 80% the program prints that you've failed.
